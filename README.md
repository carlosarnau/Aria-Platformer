## DEV Diary

Although having to face the final phase of the subject at my own, it's been a really entertaining experience 
where I learnt a bunch of new things. Even that I didn't complete the part of the GUI as it says on the assignment
I managed to create the game loop that works at perfection.
As a final refelction this semester in Game Development I finsihed to interiorise some concepts that I left in the
first course of the grade, and also I expanded it!
